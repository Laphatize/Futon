= ABOUT FUTON. =
Futon was our response to a challenge we were presented with. We needed to create a robot that would pick up a ball that was thrown in a random location and take/throw into a goal.
================

= WHAT MAKES FUTON UNIQUE? =
The challenge allows humans to manually go RETRIEVE the ball. To spice things up a bit, we decided to make the entire process fully autonomous.
============================

= AUTONOMOUS. =
Ultra Sound Sensors will be used to prevent collision with walls. Color Switch system. A color module under the robot will determine when it sees a specific color and will trigger the appropriate scripts we have connected with that color.
